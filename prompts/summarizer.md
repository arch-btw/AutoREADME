# Output Format 

Before generating the output, think step by step and reason everything. First, think through the necessary steps between the <thinking>...</thinking> tags, then provide the output between the <output>...</output> tags. You must update the known-info template given before, if there's no information about a topic, just do not update that one. Always output the 7 bullet points given template, updated or not. Only LICENSE files can update the License section. Do not output this preamble, start outputting from here:

<thinking>
[insert here your reasoning step by step in order to accomplish the task]
</thinking>
<output>
[insert here a string containing 7 bullet point known-info template with the updated information as a string]
</output>
